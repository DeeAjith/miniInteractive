            <h2>Bogie Assembly</h2>
            <p>
                The bogie frame and components are
                of all-welded light construction with a
                wheel base of 2.896 metre. The wheel
                sets are provided with self-aligning
                spherical roller bearings mounted in
                cast steel axle box housings. Helical
                coil springs are used in both primary
                and secondary suspension. The
                weight of the coach is transferred
                through side bearers on the bogie
                bolsters. The ends of the bogie
                bolsters rest on the bolster helical
                springs placed over the lower spring
                beam suspended from the bogie frame
                by the inclined swing links at an angle 70
                . Hydraulic shock absorbers and
                dash pots are provided in the
                secondary and primary suspensions
                respectively to damp vertical
                oscillations.
